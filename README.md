How to Install my Mods:

Download and open this tool and install a custom Map: http://leagueskin.net/p/download-mod-skin-lol-pro-2016-chn This do not have the new version.
Then simply Add my Map File t to:  C:\Fraps\data\Lib\Custom
It will automatically load the skin.
                                                                                                             
!!!Wooxy is not more Supported!!! 
"""Also if you close your client you need to reinstall all mods again. Because Riot uses a new Patcher that makes a clean install"""


Done.

Or just install the programm and install the map mod there: https://i.imgur.com/2o2o7k6.jpg

I don't need a Bugreport because I test all.

Bugs already: 

Old Summoners Rift Remastered
- Spells like Jinx W or Draven Q mostly bugged in Terrain
- Little grass UV is missing and is only showing in green
- Compressed 2600 Models to 96. This causes an bug on some decals
