I don't need a Bugreport because I test all.

Bugs already: 

Old Summoners Rift Remastered
- Terrain UV on Base and River is not correct
- Spells like Jinx W or Draven Q mostly bugged in Terrain
- Little grass UV is missing and is only showing in green
- On base the decal is too high
- Grass over the base is bugged in Terrain
- Compressed 2600 Models to 96. This causes an bug on Lane Rocks and Nexus Rocks
